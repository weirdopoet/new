# Storybook

The `storybook` package contains Storybook's core. It includes:

- Storybook's CLI and development server
- Storybook's main UI (aka "the manager")
- Core functionality including component controls, toolbar controls, action logging, viewport control, and interaction debugger
- User-facing utility libraries such as `storybook/test`, `theming`, and `viewport`
- Libraries used by Storybook's ecosystem of frameworks, addons, and builders

It also contains a variety of other libraries and utilities under the `stroybook/internal` namespace, such as utilities for CSF, MDX & Docs.
